# Scraping Listed Jobs

Scraping test taking listed jobs from a website, saving it into a Json file and showing the file content in a table.

Used **Puppeteer** for the scraping.

## Installation

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ node scrapingTest.js
```

The chromium browser will show up seconds later, then the **jobs.json** file will be created or overwriten and lastly the browser will close itself.

Now you can open the HTML file in the browser to see the final result.
